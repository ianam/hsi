            <p>Note: If we have an opening at this time for which we feel you are suited, we will contact you by phone within 2 weeks. Due to the volume of job applications we receive, we are unable to respond to each one individually.</p>
            <h2>International / Overseas Applicants</h2>
            <p>Thank you for your interest in our company. Before the hiring process can go any further you must become a practicing Registered Nurse in British Columbia.  This is done through the British Columbia College of Nurses and Midwives (BCCNM).</p>
            <p>The registration process with BCCNM is independent of the immigration / visa process and is always handled directly between them and each applicant. Internationally educated nurses who have never been registered in Canada may be eligible for registration to practice as an RN in B.C. To start a BCCNM application, you must first apply to the National Nursing Assessment Service (NNAS): http://www.nnas.ca.</p>
            <p>After you complete the NNAS process, BCCNM may require you to undergo a competency assessment. Therefore, you should start your application process now. This takes about 5 to 6 weeks. Further information for Foreign Applicants can be found on their website here: https://www.bccnm.ca/RN/applications_registration/how_to_apply/InternationalEN/Pages/Default.aspx</p>
            <p>You will need to send the College your English language test score before they process your application: https://www.bccnm.ca/Documents/registration_application/Englishtests.pdf</p>
            <p>Acceptance from the BCCNP does not guarantee employment. Please contact us with your results from BCCNP as soon as you receive them.</p>
