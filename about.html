                    <h2>Our Vision & Mission</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Our vision is “Balanced Healthcare for a Diverse Society”.
                Our mission is to “Facilitate Effective Use of Healthcare Resources World Wide”. We will achieve this mission through providing a broad range of health services to a broad range of customers and building a self-sustaining organization.
                In the area of nursing, we aim to build our company into a “Nursing Gateway,” a one-stop waystation for nurses in their pursuit of career opportunities, be they in Canada or around the world, be they in hospital, geriatric, or community settings.
                In the area of health care staffing, we aim to provide a full range of work options, support, education and resources for staff, clients, and communities.</p>

                    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                </div>
                <p>We believe that our corporation is made up of individuals and that each member of the company has responsibilities towards the company and the company as a whole has responsibilities towards each of its members.
                Health Staffing International believes that aligning individual and organizational goals will achieve the best results for everyone and that by working as a team we will achieve better results than by working individually.
                We believe that success includes our provision of value to our community, including volunteerism as well as quality of service. We wish to ultimately have a positive and measurable effect on our community and upon the world.</p>
