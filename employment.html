        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content-row">
        <div class="content-col col-lt">
            <p>Flexibility</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-col col-rt">
            <p>A Health Staffing Nurse is able to design your own work schedule. Each staff member is in complete control of their own work schedule. You may choose which days you want to work and which days you want to have off. Different days may be selected each week. 
            For part-time placements if you work elsewhere, our scheduling process allows you to fill in your available time without conflicting with your current rotation. It doesn't matter if your days off are the same each week or changing all the time. We typically have assignments available every day and every time slot. Our assignments can be accessed singly or in blocks.</p>

        <div class="content-col col-lt">
            <p>Variety & Versatility</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-col col-rt">
            <p>Health Staffing International staff have the opportunity to work in a variety of nursing settings. Nurses will gain valuable exposure to different types of health care institutions enabling them to better plan their long-range career path. 
            Our staff have access to a variety of Nursing specialty areas including Acute Care, OR, Cardiac, Emergency, Maternity, Psychiatric, Multi-level Care facilities, Extended care units, private hospitals, home support agencies, alcohol and drug rehabilitation centres, private surgical centres, group homes, mental health boarding homes, special care units, and seniorsâ€™ centres in all the major health regions of British Columbia as well as Nurse Educator opportunities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-col col-lt">
            <p>Higher Wages</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-col col-rt">
            <p>Our staff generally fill vacancies that would otherwise be filled by the hospital requiring one of their own staff to work at overtime rates so we are able to offer more competitive rates than long-term care facilities or hospitals. We also choose to pay higher wages to our Nurses instead of maintaining costly accumulations such as compassionate leave credits.
            With Health Staffing International, you may work as a Contractor instead of as an Employee to gain significant advantages under Canadian Tax laws. The principle advantage is that your place of work is your own home. You may deduct the costs of getting to each work assignment (including vehicle depreciation, insurance, and maintenance). This factor alone is worth several thousand dollars to many of our staff. Many other costs directly related to your work with our agency become eligible deductions: e.g., telephone, pager, fax, and computer equipment, attendance at conferences and workshops, etc.</p>

            <p>Family</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-col col-rt">
            <p>There is the atmosphere of an extended family. We help staff when they are 'down' and we share their joy when they are 'up.' If a staff member needs their pay a day or a week early, we are able to respond because we are not tied to a large inflexible payroll system, and because we are an extended family.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-col col-lt">
            <p>Less Stress</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-col col-rt">
            <p>Our staff are bound only to the schedule they know they can handle from week to week. They are not forced to work overtime when they are exhausted. They can alter their work availability on a daily basis so as to better fit with their personal needs. 
            All staff are given on-the-job introduction and training to assist them in adjusting to the systems and routines of each institution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-col col-lt">
            <p>No Politics</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-col col-rt">
            <p>Often in work settings people are pulled into or away from established cliques. Too often workers become pawns in the struggle between union and employer, facility and funding ministry. Our staff do not have to choose sides in these instances. You can choose to go back to those settings or you can instruct our scheduling office to send you to other facilities instead. In unionized work-stoppages we can cross picket lines because we are assisting the union in meeting their requirements under essential services legislation. We are not taking away union jobs, we are only filling in after the union resources are exhausted. </p>
